title: Quasar Roadmap
---

Next Quasar version is v1.0. Quasar's main focus points at the moment are:
* Notable improvements to the form components
* Total documentation website revamp, using Quasar SSR. Better "view source" functionality, with ability to fork and play each example on JsFiddle.
* Quasar Icon Factory - automatically generate necessary icons for all platforms (favicons, mobile icons, electron icons, ...) from one image file used as source
* Quasar CLI testing module (with your favorite assertion library and favorite test runner)
* Alternative to Quasar SSR: Nuxt module (for ability to use Quasar + Nuxt)
* Out of the box Typescript support (can be added now too)

Notable features on the roadmap for longer term (some might end up in v1.0):
* Chrome (+ Firefox) extension Quasar CLI mode
* Tipster component
* List Item Sliding with Actions component
* Virtual Lists component
